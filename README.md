Making a neural network that can be trained to recognise human handwritten characters.

Note: a collection of images of handwritten numbers used in this project is called MNIST database of handwritten digits, and is available from the neural network researcher Yann LeCun’s website ​http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.​
